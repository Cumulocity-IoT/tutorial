<!-- The c8y-title component will display the given string (here: "Outstanding Tab") in the header as title -->
<c8y-title>Outstanding tab</c8y-title>
<div class="card">
  <div class="card-block">
    <p>
      This is the first tab we added with the
      <code>hookTab</code>
      . Note: If only one tab is used, the tabs are not rendered at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tabs are by default orientated vertical. You can however set an application option or define
      the orientation on the tab interface itself, to change the orientation. The following button
      toggles the orientation for the whole application:
    </p>
    <button
      class="btn btn-primary"
      (click)="toggleOrientation()"
    >
      Toggle orientation
    </button>
  </div>
</div>

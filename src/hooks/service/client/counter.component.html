  Hello there! I am a simple component added from a plugin by
  <code>hookComponent</code>
  . I use a shared counter service that has been provided in another plugin and injected by
  <code>hookService</code>
  .

<button
  class="btn btn-default m-t-16"
  type="button"
  (click)="counter.count()"
>
  Click to increment counter
  <span class="badge badge-system">{{ counter.counter }}</span>
</button>
